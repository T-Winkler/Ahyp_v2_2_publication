## raw_data/betalain_quantification/

Betalain quantification from leaf and flower of parental lines used in the bulk segregant analysis (BSA) and of amaranth hairy roots of AhMYB2.1 overexpression.

Quantification of betalain content in leaf and flower from BSA parental lines using photometry (sheet "Photometric_quantification") and LC-MS (sheet "LC-MS_quantification"). Photometric and LC-MS quantification was done from the same betalain extracts. Sample names in LC-MS quantification correspond to tube_nr column in the photometric quantification sheet. For betalain extraction, the initial solvent(H2O)/fresh weight ratio was set equal within tissue and batch. Relative quantification using LC-MS was conducted against the internal standard sinigrin.

Relative quantification from from hairy roots of AhMYB2.1 overexpression plants (sheet "transgenic_roots_LC-MS_quantification"). Transformed and wild-type like tissue was sampled from two successfully transformed individuals.
